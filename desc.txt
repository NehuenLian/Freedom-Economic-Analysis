This project is about the economic freedom of several countries in the world, and also the economic freedom of the continents.

I used automatized functions that looks in the dataframe the parameters that i request when i call the function, and also a manual form.
An automatized function will be better when we need save time. And a manual function will be better when we want the total control of the code.

Talking about the theme of the project, here are some insights:
(There are more parameters to analyze, but i chose that i considerer the most importants).

-Property Rights
-Goverment Integrity
-Judicial Efectiveness
-Monetary Freedom
-Fiscal Health

-Overall Score is a general score about the continent or country which is better in all parameter.

Europe seems be the continent with the highest economic freedom comparing other regions.
European countries lead most tables, specially in the Goverment Integrity, that is, corruption.
The countries that lead the Overall Score table are mostly small territories and fiscal paradises, or are closely associated with them, like Switzerland, Singapore, or Luxembourg, among others.
There are no countries of South America in any tables, and the only Countries of the Americas in some tables are United States and Canada
